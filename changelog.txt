2016/10/13: 
  Small fixes.
  
2016/10/14:
  Removed the rvalue types (rset, relem, rnum, rsetof). Their only purpose was
  to signify the lack of internal context in case of rvariables, but using them
  leads to much less elegant code in general.

  Added the test program 'learning nominal automata' (tests/learning.cpp).
